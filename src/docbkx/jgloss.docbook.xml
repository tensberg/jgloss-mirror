                is an application for adding reading and translation annotations
                to words in a Japanese text document. This can be done automatically and
                manually. When a text document is first opened, words will be looked
                up in dictionary files and the first reading and translation (if any) is used to
                annotate the word. The user can then edit the annotations: choose among the
                readings and translations found in the dictionaries, enter own readings and
                translations, remove annotations and add new annotations. The document
                can be exported as plain text with annotations, HTML (with support for
                the

            <para>
                The application is designed as a translation aid for people learning Japanese.
                With some new document, you can first skim the text and change the annotations
                to match the likeliest meaning of the word. Then you can print/export the text
                with annotations and start working on the details of understanding the text
                without having to resort to a paper dictionary all the time.

                Your computer system should already be configured to work with Japanese text. You must
                have a Japanese font installed. Having a Japanese input method installed is not absolutely
                necessary, but very useful. As a test, if your web browser can display Japanese text, it should
                be possible to set up Java do do the same.

                                EDICT dictionaries are Japanese to English word dictionaries. You can download them

                                . Each dictionary also needs an index file.
                                If no index file is found, it will be created automatically by

                                dictionary directory. Should the index file creation fail, for example because the
                                directory is write-protected, the dictionary can't be used and an error message is
                                shown.

                window after some text is imported.
                The top-left part of the window shows the annotated document. An annotated word is shown
                in light red, with the reading annotation above and the translation annotation below the

                The bottom-left part of the window contains the annotation editor. For the selected annotation
                the annotation editor shows the current reading and translation,
                and dictionary form of the entry. You can use the annotation editor
                to change the reading and translation of a word by editing the text in the text fields.
            </para>
            <para>
                The bottom-right part shows dictionary search results for the currently selected text. If you select an
                annotation, the annotated word is automatically searched. Click on a result to use it as the new reading
                or translation. If you select some unannotated text in the top-left document view, it will also be automatically
                searched. Click on the <guibutton>Annotate selection...</guibutton> button to add an annotation for the selected text.
            </para>
            <para>
                The heuristics used for generating the annotations are not perfect.
                For example, if you import a text using the EDICT2 dictionary file,
                <foreignphrase xml:lang="ja">æ¥ã</foreignphrase>
                is assigned the reading
                <foreignphrase xml:lang="ja">ããã</foreignphrase>
                instead of
                <foreignphrase xml:lang="ja">ãã</foreignphrase>
                and
                <foreignphrase xml:lang="ja">ä¸äºº</foreignphrase>
                is assigned the reading
                <foreignphrase xml:lang="ja">ãã¡ã«ã</foreignphrase>
                instead of the more common
                <foreignphrase xml:lang="ja">ã²ã¨ã</foreignphrase>.
                This happens because the application picks the first reading and translation
                found in the dictionary. Also, the algorithm used for verb/adjective deinflection can produce
                false results. What follows is that you should not always trust the automatic annotations, 
                the document will require some editing to be correct.

            <para>
                A common option for all formats is the character encoding of the generated file.
                What encoding you use depends mainly on what application you want to use the exported
                file with. Modern web browsers should support all of the encodings. For other applications,
                if you are working on Windows, you should try Shift-JIS and on Linux EUC-JP. If the document
                or your annotations contain characters not in ASCII or the Japanese character set
                (
                <abbrev>e. g.</abbrev>
                German umlauts), you should use UTF-8, which can represent all characters.

                    If you export the document in HTML format, the document can viewed in any web browser
                    that supports display of Japanese characters.
                    The document title set in JGloss will be used as the title of the HTML document.

                    browsers which support it will render the annotations above/below the annotated words.
                    Translations are shown using JavaScript
                    in a floating window and the status bar of the browser when the user moves the mouse
                    over an annotated word. In Firefox and other browsers
                    which don't support ruby annotations but support the neccessary JavaScript functions, reading
                    annotations will be shown in a floating window above the annotated word and in the status bar.
                    In other browsers, the
                    reading annotations will be shown in the document after the annotated word, the translations

                    Standard LaTeX can't handle Japanese documents. JGloss therefore uses the CJK macro package,

                    In order to use it, you will have to download and install the macro package and the
                    corresponding font package. On Ubuntu Linux, simply install the package <application>latex-cjk-japanese</application> 
                    (type <userinput>sudo apt-get install latex-cjk-japanese</userinput> in a command prompt).
                    Once the package is installed, you can process the files

                JGloss can use two different parsers for the automatic annotation of Japanese text, the
                Kanji parser and the ChaSen parser. Select the parser by clicking the respective radio
                button. The ChaSen parser will only be available if the chasen program is installed
                (see below).

                If the
                <guilabel>annotate first occurrence</guilabel>
                option is selected, each word in a
                document is only annotated the first time it appears. This decreases the RAM usage and
                the time it takes to display the document. The
                <guilabel>Guess paragraph breaks</guilabel>
                option controls how line breaks in the imported document are converted to paragraph breaks.
                If the option is selected, JGloss tries to determine if a line break in the imported document
                signifies the end of a paragraph or if it is used for formatting reasons only. In the second
                case, it will be ignored.

                Some documents you can find on the internet
                already have reading annotations added to kanji words in the form of some hiragana

                reading annotation entries for these words. You can select the brackets used in the document
                for reading annotations with the
                <guilabel>Brackets used...</guilabel>

                <para>
                    The Kanji parser is built into JGloss. A simple heuristic is used for choosing words to annotate:
                    for a sequence of katakana characters, the whole sequence is treated as one word and
                    looked up. For a sequence of kanji characters followed by hiragana characters, the
                    algorithm first looks for possible inflected forms in the hiragana string and will
                    try to find words that consist of the kanji word and the dictionary form of the inflected
                    forms that appear in the hiragana string. If no match is found, only the kanji part
                    is looked up. If still no match is found in any of the dictionaries, prefixes of the
                    kanji word will be tried and if this leads to a match the process will be repeated with
                    the remainder. A consequence of this method is that hiragana words will never be annotated
                    automatically even if they are in the dictionaries.

                <para>
                    The ChaSen parser uses the ChaSen morphological analysis program to decompose Japanese
                    text in words and to derive the base form of inflected words.
                    It is slower than the Kanji parser, but will annotate hiragana words as
                    well as kanji and katakana words. It also does a better job of deinflecting verbs and
                    adjectives. You can download ChaSen
                    from
                    <link xlink:href="http://chasen-legacy.sourceforge.jp/">the ChaSen homepage</link>
                    . On Ubuntu Linux, you can simply install the package <application>chasen</application>
                    (<userinput>sudo apt-get install chasen</userinput>).
                    After installation, you have to set the path to the chasen executable in the
                    <link linkend="sect.prefs.general">preferences dialog</link>
                    . It usually is

                    <filename>c:\Program Files\chasen21\chasen.exe</filename>

                <para>
                    The ChaSen program is used to generate a list of words with their reading and base form from
                    the parsed text. The words will be looked up in the dictionaries, and if an entry is
                    found, an annotation will be generated. If no dictionary entry is found and the word
                    is not inflected, kanji substrings will be tried. A reading annotation with the reading
                    output by ChaSen is also added if the reading returned by ChaSen is different from the first
                    reading found in the dictionaries. Since the ChaSen program uses its own set of dictionaries
                    to detect words, it might not recognize words which are found in the dictionaries used by JGloss
                    but not in the ChaSen dictionaries.
