<!--
  An export descriptor XML file describes an export format used by JGloss.
  JGloss builds the export menu from the export descriptor files. If the user
  selects an export menu item, JGloss reads the export descriptor file and builds
  a dialog in which the user can select the output file and the specified parameters.

  The creation of the export file itself is done by applying an XSLT file to the JGloss
  document (represented as XML). The XML tree provided to the XSLT file has the following
  form:
  - Root of the tree is a <jgloss-export> element
  - For every parameter defined in the export descriptor (see below), an element is created as child
    of /jgloss-export/parameters/, with the name as defined in the export descriptor and the
    value selected by the user.
  - The JGloss document has the same form as the JGloss save file format. The original root node <jgloss>
    is the second child of <jgloss-export>.
