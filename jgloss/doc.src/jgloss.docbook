    <sect1><title>What it is</title>
      <para>
        &JGloss; is an application for adding reading and translation annotations
        to words in a Japanese text document. This can be done automatically and
        manually. When a text document is first opened, kanji words will be looked
        up in a dictionary and the first reading and translation (if any) used to
        annotate the word. The user can then edit the annotations: choose among the
        readings and translations found in the dictionaries, enter own readings and
        translations, remove annotations and add new annotations. The document
        can be exported as plain text with annotations, HTML (with support for
        the <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/">
          <citetitle>Ruby Annotation</citetitle></ulink> XHTML specification) or LaTeX.
      </para>
      <para>
        I intend it mainly as a translation aid for students of Japanese (like me).
        With some new document, you can first skim the text and change the annotations
        to match the likeliest meaning of the word. Then you can print/export the text
        with annotations and start working on the details of understanding the text.
      </para>
      <para>
        &JGloss; is written in Java. It should work on any computer with support
        for the Java 2 Version 1.3 platform.

        &JGloss; is written by Michael Koch <email>tensberg@gmx.net</email>. 
        It was inspired by Jim Breen's work, particularly the

  <chapter><title>Making it work</title>
    <sect1 id="sect.whatyouneed"><title>What you need</title>
      <para>
        &JGloss; is a Java application. To run it, you will need a Java implementation that
        conforms to the Java 2 Version 1.3 specifications, <abbrev>e. g.</abbrev> Sun's
        <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/">
          <application>Java Runtime Environment 1.3</application></ulink>(<acronym>JRE</acronym>).
        Make sure that you have the international version.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your computer system should already be configured to work with Japanese text. You must
        have a Japanese font installed. Having a Japanese input method working is not absolutely
        necessary, but very useful. As a test, if your web browser can display Japanese, it should
        be possible to set up Java do do the same. See also <xref linkend="sect.Japanesejava">.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you want to use the automatic annotation function, you will need some dictionaries.
        &JGloss; currently supports dictionaries in the 
        <ulink url="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict_doc.html">EDICT format</ulink>.
        You will also have to create the <filename>xjdx</filename> index files for the dictionaries.
        A tool for this does not come with &JGloss;, you can use the tool coming with 
        <application>XJDIC</application>, <application>GJiten</application> or some other package
        supporting EDICT.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><title>Running &JGloss;</title>
      <para>
        &JGloss; requires no installation. On a <application>Windows</application> box,
        double-clicking the <filename>jgloss.jar</filename> file should start the application.
        To start &JGloss; from a shell, change to the directory which contains the 
        <acronym>JAR</acronym> file and enter <userinput>java -jar jgloss.jar</userinput>.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sect.Japanesejava"><title>Making Java work with Japanese text</title>
      <para>
        If Japanese is set as your computer system's default language, &JGloss; should work without
        any further setup. If not, you should at least have a Japanese font installed.
        A Japanese input method, while not required, should also be installed.
        If you are using Sun's <application>Java Runtime Environment</application>, make sure
        that you have the international version installed (the smaller version comes only with
        English locale settings).
      </para>
      <para>
        The easiest way to get Java to use Japanese fonts is to set the 
        <envar>user.language</envar> parameter to <literal>ja</literal>: start &JGloss; as
        <userinput>java -Duser.language=ja -jar jgloss.jar</userinput>. Unfortunately, at
        least on my Linux box, this will not make Java use the
        Japanese input method. On <application>Unix</application> systems, a second way is to
        set the <envar>LANG</envar> environment variable to <literal>ja_JP</literal>
        in a shell and then run &JGloss; from that shell. This will also make Java recognize
        an installed Japanese input method.
      </para>
      <para>
        An alternative method, and one that allows more customization of what fonts to use,
        is to edit the <filename>font.properties</filename> files. The 
        <filename>font.properties</filename> files are stored in the <filename>lib</filename>
        folder in the install directory of the <application>Java Runtime Environment</application>.
        They contain the settings for the fonts to used default fonts, for dialogs and the like.
        Which file is used depends on the locale setting of the operating system, <abbrev>e. g.</abbrev>
        if you are running in a Japanese environment, the <filename>font.properties.ja</filename>
        will be used. If there is no matching file for the current locale, the
        <filename>font.properties</filename> file will be used. This file contains no definition
        for Japanese fonts, but you can edit it and add these fonts. The easiest way to do this
        is to simply rename the file <filename>font.properties.ja</filename> to 
        <filename>font.properties</filename> (but make a backup of the original file first). You
        can also edit the file to make it use different fonts. The file 
        <filename>psfonts.properties.ja</filename> controls what fonts are used when printing
        a document which contains Japanese characters.
      </para>
      <para>
        On <application>Windows 2000</application>, the <application>JRE</application> supports
        the Japanese input method regardless of the system language settings, but you will have
        to use one of the methods mentioned above to get Java to use Japanese fonts. I had no luck
        so far in getting the JRE to use the input method under <application>Windows 98</application>.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1><title>Do It Yourself</title>
      <para>
        This section describes how to build &JGloss; from the sources. You do not need to read
        it if you just want to use &JGloss;.
      </para>
      <para>
        To build the &JGloss; JAR file, you have to have the 
        <application>Java Development Kit 1.3</application> from SUN (or something compatible) 
        installed. To create the different documentation files from <filename>jgloss.docbook</filename>
        you need the DocBook 3.1 DTD and various DocBook tools. Look for them at
        the <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">OASIS site</ulink>, 
        <ulink url="http://nwalsh.com/docbook/">Norman Walsh</ulink>'s site
        or on your favorite Linux distribution's CD-ROM.
      </para>
      <para>
        The sources come with a <filename>Makefile</filename> which automates the build process.
        The Makefile is written for a GNU/Linux system, but might work on other systems with
        the GNU tools or equivalent commands installed. The default <command>make</command> target 
        will create the <filename>jgloss.jar</filename> application archive. Some of the other 
        <command>make</command> targets are:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry><term><command>compile</command></term>
            <listitem><para>Compiles all Java class files.</para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry><term><command>doc</command></term>
            <listitem><para>Generates the documentation files from 
                <filename>doc/jgloss.docbook</filename></para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry><term><command>gen-javadoc</command></term>
            <listitem><para>Generates the javadoc documentation for the JGloss source files.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry><term><command>dist</command></term>
            <listitem><para>Creates the source and binary distribution zip and tgz files.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
      </para>
      <para>
        If you can't use the Makefile, you can build the JGloss JAR archive by hand. Use
        <command>javac</command> to compile the <filename>*.java</filename> files in the 
        <filename>src</filename> directory. Use <command>native2ascii</command> to convert
        every <filename>.properties.in</filename> file in the <filename>src/resources</filename>
        directory to a <filename>.properties</filename> file using the <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
        charset. The native charset of the file is specified in the first line of the
        input file. Then use <command>jar</command> to build a JAR archive, using the
        <filename>MANIFEST.MF</filename> file as manifest (see <command>jar</command> options).
        Make sure that the <filename>resources</filename> and <filename>data</filename>
        directories are included in the archive.

  <chapter><title>Using JGloss</title>
    <sect1><title>Quickstart</title>
      <para>
        When you start &JGloss; for the first time, you should first set the dictionary files
        which you want to use. Choose the <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> item from
        the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu, and select the <guimenuitem>Dictionaries</guimenuitem>
        tab in the newly opened window. Add the dictionaries you want to use and hit
        <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. Note that dictionary entries will be chosen in the order
        of the dictionaries, so put your preferred dictionaries higher in the list.
      </para>
      <para>
        Use the <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> item from the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu
        to open the import dialog. Enter the URL of the file you want to import, or select 
        a local file by hitting the <guibutton>Choose file</guibutton> button. Once you push
        <guibutton>Import</guibutton>, the text will be parsed and annotations will be added
        by looking up words in the text in the dictionaries. After some time 
        (this can take rather long for larger texts) the annotated document will be 
        displayed in the window.

            The left part of the &JGloss; window shows the annotated document

      <para>
        <xref linkend="figure.main"> shows the &JGloss; window after some text is imported.
        The left part of the window shows the annotated document. An annotated word is shown
        in light red, with the reading annotation above and the translation annotation below the
        word. The right part of the window contains the annotation editor. For every annotated word,
        it will display the word and below it the current reading and translation annotation, and
        all readings and translations found in the dictionary. You can use the annotation editor
        to change the reading and translation of a word, either by selecting one of the listed
        entries, or by selecting the current reading/translation item and entering the new text.
      </para>
      <para>
        As you can see, the heuristics used for generating the annotations are not perfect.
        For example, in the imported text, 
        <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="img/kuru_kanji.png" scale="50">
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase>kuru (written with kanji)</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
        is assigned the reading
        <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="img/kitaru.png" scale="50">
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase>kitaru</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
        instead of 
        <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="img/kuru.png" scale="50">
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase>kuru</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
        and 
        <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="img/hitori_kanji.png" scale="50">
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase>hitori (written with kanji)</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
        is assigned the reading
        <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="img/ichinin.png" scale="50">
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase>ichinin</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
        instead of the more common 
        <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="img/hitori.png" scale="50">
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase>hitori</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
        . This happens because the application picks the the first reading and translation 
        found in a dictionary. Also, the algorithm used for verb/adjective deinflection can produce
        false results. What follows is you should not trust the automatic annotations too much
        and that the document will require some editing. 
      </para>
      <para>
        To edit an annotation, select it in the annotation editor. The selected entry will be
        highlighted red in the document view. Use the down key to select an entry with the appropriate
        reading or translation and hit the space bar. This will make the selected
        entry the reading/translation of the annotation. To manually edit the text of an annotation,
        select the <guimenuitem>Reading</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Translation</guimenuitem>
        item and hit space to start editing.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you are finished with editing your document, you can export it to different formats.
        Select <guimenuitem>HTML</guimenuitem> from the <guisubmenu>Export</guisubmenu>
        entry in the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu. In the file chooser you can select which type of
        annotations will be written. Select a file name and save the HTML file. If you are using
        the <application>Internet Explorer 5.5</application>, which already more or less supports the
        <citetitle>Ruby Annotation</citetitle> XHTML specification, the ruby in the document will be
        rendered above the annotated word. Otherwise, it will be inserted after the annotated word.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sect.docview"><title>The Document View</title>
      <para>
        The left part of the window shows the annotated document. Annotated words will have a colored
        background. You can change the colors or switch them off in the 
        <link linkend="sect.prefs.general">Preferences dialog</link> and toggle the display
        of reading and translation annotations in the <link linkend="sect.menu.view">View menu</link>.
        If you left-click on an annotated word, a popup window will show all dictionary entries
        for this word. A right-click will select this word in the annotation editor and pop up
        a context menu with options for this annotation (see 
        <xref linkend="sect.menu.annotation">). To add an annotation, select some text
        and use <guimenuitem>Annotate Selection</guimenuitem> in the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu
        (see <xref linkend="sect.menu.edit">).
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sect.annotationeditor"><title>The Annotation Editor</title>
      <para>
        The annotation editor is used to edit the reading and translation annotations of annotated
        words in the document. It is displayed in the right half of the &JGloss; window
        (see <xref linkend="figure.main">). Each annotated word has an entry in the editor, ordered
        by its appearance in the document. The entries are displayed in a hierarchical style.
        If an entry is selected, the annotation will be highlighted in the document view.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use the keyboard to navigate in the editor. The <keycap>cursor up/down</keycap>
        keys will move the selection by one item. To move to the next annotation press
        <keycap>N</keycap>, to move to the previous annotation press <keycap>P</keycap>.
        Pressing <keycap>space</keycap> will do something useful, depending on what kind of item is
        currently selected (see below). Right-clicking an entry with the mouse will show a context menu for
        the chosen item, see <xref linkend="sect.menu.annotation">.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first item under the annotated word is the current reading. To edit the reading,
        select the item and hit <keycap>space</keycap>, or click it twice and wait a moment.
        When you are done with editing, press <keycap>return</keycap>, and the document view
        will be updated with the new reading.
        The second item shows the current translation. It is edited in the same way as the
        reading.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some text documents you can find on the net are already annotated with readings 
        by placing the reading in brackets after a word. These readings will be recognized 
        during importing and used used as reading
        annotation. They are shown in the <guimenuitem>Reading from document</guimenuitem> items.
        Selecting one and hitting <keycap>space</keycap> will make it the reading of the
        annotation.
      </para>
      <para>
        For every dictionary in which an entry for the annotated word is found, an item
        will be generated showing the dictionary name. Under the name, for each entry the
        dictionary word and reading will be shown, and under that one item for every translation.
        If you select a reading and hit <keycap>space</keycap>, the reading will be made the new
        reading of the annotation, and likewise for a translation. If a dictionary entry was found
        using the verb/adjective de-inflection algorithm, the item will show the dictionary form
        of the word and in brackets the grammatical form in which the word appears in the document.
        Note that this algorithm may show wrong grammatical forms and therefore this feature
        should not always be trusted.

        To create a new annotated document, select <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> or
        <guimenuitem>Import Clipboard</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.
        <guimenuitem>Import Clipboard</guimenuitem> will create a new document from the
        content of the system clipboard and needs no further setup.

      <para>
        Selecting <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> will show the 
        <guilabel>Import File</guilabel> dialog. In the text field you can enter
        an HTTP URL or the file name of a local document. The document should be plain text.
        There is some support for importing <acronym>HTML</acronym> documents, but
        the layout usually does not work very well. If you hit the <guibutton>Choose File</guibutton>
        button, a file chooser dialog will pop up and let you select a local file.
        The character encoding of the file can be selected in the 
        <guilabel>Character encoding ...</guilabel> popup menu. You can usually
        leave it on the <guilabel>&lt;auto&gt;</guilabel> setting, which will make &JGloss;
        auto-detect the encoding of the file. If the auto-detection fails for a file, you can
        select the encoding manually. If a text document already contains annotations with the
        reading of kanji words, the import parser will use these readings for the automatically
        generated annotations. The readings must appear after a kanji word, enclosed in brackets
        which you can select in the <guilabel>Brackets ...</guilabel> popup menu. If the document
        does not contain annotations, you can ignore the settings. Hitting the 
        <guibutton>Import</guibutton> button will import the selected file.
      </para>
      <para>
        The import process will automatically generate annotations for the file by looking up
        words in the user-selected dictionaries. A simple heuristic decides what is looked up:
        for a sequence of katakana characters, the whole sequence is treated as one word and
        looked up. For a sequence of kanji characters followed by hiragana characters, the
        algorithm first looks for possible inflected forms in the hiragana string and will
        try to find words that consist of the kanji word and the dictionary form of the inflected
        forms that appear in the hiragana string. If no match is found, only the kanji part
        is looked up. If still no match is found in any of the dictionaries, prefixes of the
        kanji word will be tried and if this leads to a match the process will be repeated with
        the remainder. A consequence of this is that hiragana words will never be annotated
        automatically even if they are in the dictionaries. You can add annotations to them
        manually later.
      </para>
      <para>
        If there was a reading annotation in the document for the annotated word, this reading
        will be used for the reading annotation, and the first translation found with this reading
        will be used for the translation annotation. Otherwise, the first reading and translation
        found in a dictionary will be used for the annotation. You can change this later.

        <para>
          The &JGloss; application is quite resource intensive. It can take a rather long time
          for the newly imported document to be displayed. You should consider breaking a long text
          in several shorter files.
        </para>
      </note>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sect.export"><title>Exporting annotated documents</title>
      <para>
        &JGloss; supports the exporting of annotated documents in several formats, described below.
        You can select one of the formats from the <guisubmenu>Export</guisubmenu> submenu in 
        the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.
      </para>
      <para>
        A common option for all formats is the character encoding of the generated file.
        What format you use depends mainly on what application you want to use the exported
        file with. Modern web browsers should support all of the encodings. For other applications,
        if you are working on Windows, you should try Shift-JIS and on Unix EUC-JP. If the document
        or your annotations contain characters not in ASCII or the Japanese character set
        (<abbrev>e. g.</abbrev> umlauts), you should use UTF-8, which takes more disk space
        but can represent all characters.
      </para>
      <sect2><title><acronym>HTML</acronym></title>
        <para>
          If you export the document in HTML format, the document can viewed in any web browser
          that supports display of Japanese characters. The markup defined in the
          <citetitle>Ruby Annotation</citetitle> specification is used to embed the annotations,
          so browsers which support it can place the annotations above/below the annotated words.
          On browsers which don't support it, the annotations will be rendered after the annotated
          word.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you select the <guilabel>Interactive HTML</guilabel> option, Javascript
          will be used in the generated document to interactively show and hide the annotations
          on browsers which support it. Annotations will initially be hidden. When the user
          clicks on an annotated word, the annotation is shown. On browsers which don't support
          the necessary Javascript functions, the annotations will always be shown.
        </para>
        <para>
          With the <guilabel>Backwards compatible</guilabel> option, you can control the form
          of generated HTML. Usually, the annotations are put in brackets to distinguish
          them from the normal flow of text. On browsers which support 
          ruby annotations, this is not only unnecessary but would
          look wrong. If <guilabel>Backwards compatible</guilabel> is selected, the generated
          HTML will use brackets, and a Javascript will remove the brackets from the
          annotations if they are not needed when the document is loaded in the browser.
          The documents will be usable in all browsers, even if they don't support
          ruby annotations and Javascript. If it is unchecked, the generated document will not
          have brackets around annotations. The brackets will be added by Javascript when the
          document is loaded on browsers not supporting ruby annotations. This means less
          work for modern browsers but will generate documents that don't work as well with
          older browsers or browsers with Javascript disabled. As an added bonus, try importing
          the HTML document in <application>Word 2000</application>. <application>Word 2000</application>
          understands ruby annotations and will use them in the imported document.
        </para>
        <para>
          With the <guilabel>write "hidden" annotations</guilabel> you can control how to

          The annotation list export function will write a text file listing all annotations
          in the document. Annotations will only be written once, duplicate entries will be
          skipped. You can use the generated text as a basis for a vocabulary list, but
          the file will need some editing.

        The preferences dialog contains two tabs, one for setting the visual appearance
        of the application and one for selecting the dictionaries used when importing
        a document. You can access the dialog by selecting <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
        from the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu.
      </para>
      <sect2 id="sect.prefs.general"><title>General</title>
        <para>
          Here you can set the appearance for annotated words in the document view.
          Select the font by using the popup menu. Note that not all fonts in the list
          can display Japanese characters. The font size can be selected from the
          popup menu to the right, or you can enter the font size manually if it is not in
          the list. You can select a different background color by clicking on the button
          with the color label, or disable the use of a background color by unchecking the
          <guilabel>set background color</guilabel> checkbox. The 
          <guilabel>Highlight color ...</guilabel> button lets you select the color
          which is used for highlighting the currently selected annotation in the document view.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you select the <guilabel>Enable direct editing</guilabel> checkbox, you can
          edit the text in the document view like you would in a text editor. Unfortunately
          this function does not work very well and you should save the document before enabling
          it. Problems include positioning the cursor, no actualization of the annotation
          editor for changed annotations and problems if you delete an annotation by removing
          all characters from it. An alternative to this is to edit the saved &JGloss;
          document, either as source in a normal text editor or by loading it into an HTML
          editor.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Dictionaries</title>
        <para>
          In this dialog you can set the dictionaries which are used when importing a text
          or adding annotations to a document manually. Click the 
          <guibutton>Add dictionary file</guibutton> to add one or more new dictionaries to
          the list. &JGloss; currently supports dictionaries in the EDICT format. The directory
          must also contain the <filename>xjdx</filename> index file associated with the
          dictionary file (see <xref linkend="sect.whatyouneed">). Select a dictionary from
          the list and push <guibutton>Remove entry</guibutton> to remove it.
        </para>
        <para>
          Since the automatic annotation process will search the dictionaries in the sequence
          in which they are displayed in the list and use the first entry as default annotation, 
          you should put your favorite dictionary first in the list. Select one of the dictionaries
          and push <guibutton>Move entry up</guibutton> and <guibutton>Move entry down</guibutton>
          do move it to the desired position.
