0.9.2: (2001/07/32)
        - Added a JGloss servlet. The servlet proxies web pages and
	  annotates them with Japanese translations.
	- Extreme speedup of EDICT lookups. The old entry match test was
	  really broken.
	- Changed EDICT indexing algorithm. The new algorithm is faster
	  and uses far less RAM.
	- Added French translation, contributed by Alexandre Beraud.
	- Added paste import window. Text pasted in this window will be
	  imported in a new JGloss document. This is mainly useful
	  for working with the X primary selection. It is accessible with
	  the -p command line option.
	- Added composite verb detection to parser.
	- Added dictionary form node to annotation editor. This allows
	  greater control over what will be written in LaTeX and
	  annotation list exports.
	- HTML export: files now show reading and translation in popup
	  windows in browsers which support the neccessary JavaScript
	  functions, and in the status bar.
	- Added command line option -a, which annotates Japanese words in
	  a HTML page with dictionary entries.
	- Creation of the preferences panel and loading of the dictionaries
	  now happens in the background. This decreases the perceived
	  startup time.
	- Popup menus will be positioned to always fit on the screen.
0.9.1: (2001/07/13)
	- Added support for KANJIDIC dictionaries.
	- Added support for SKK word-reading dictionaries.
	- Added command line option for dictionary format detection.
	- Added word exclusion list to automatic annotation.
	- Added index file format JJDX, which can be used instead of
	  XJDX index files. JGloss will create the index if none is
	  found.
	- Added command line options for JJDX creation and opening
	  JGloss files.
	- Added command to remove duplicate annotations.
        - Improved HTML import. Still not very useful, though.
	- Speeded up initial display of documents. Unfortunately,
	  it is still slow.
	- The annotation editor shows readings/translations for hidden
	  annotations.
	- LaTeX: changed ruby size in ruby-annotation.sty
        - Hidden annotations are not expanded after a document
	  is loaded.
	- Fixed addition of space character when starting editing of
	  readings or translations.
	- Fixed apply button in preferences dialog not working.
	- Fixed unchecking background color settings will not change
	  colors.
	- Fixed using 'n' to select next annotation expands hidden
	  annotations.
	- Fixed scrolling of document when using 'n'.
	- Fixed cancel button when adding annotations manually.
0.9: (2001/06/14)
	- Initial release.
