0.9.5: (2001/12/05)
	- Improved handling of long result lists in word lookup dialog.
	- Removed the dummy print menu item from the word lookup dialog.
	- Fixed exception thrown if the document window is closed while
	  a document is loaded.
	- Removed the "enable direct editing" entry from the preferences
	  dialog since this feature is buggy and can break the document
	  if not used with care. If you still want to use it, add the
	  line "editor.enableeditingcheckbox=true" to the ".jgloss"
	  preferences file.
	- Verb inflection in word lookup dialog will not be used any
	  longer for hiragana-only search expressions.
	- Find dialog defaults to currently selected text.
	- Added file chooser icons for known file types.
	- LaTeX export can now alternatively put translations at the end of
	  the document.
	- Improved LaTeX translation formatting.
	- Word lookup window now remembers its size.
	- Left-clicking an annotated word now selects the annotation. This
	  behavior can be changed back in the preferences.
	- Style changes in the preferences are only applied once.
	- When annotating a word, the first reading and translation are now
	  automatically selected.
0.9.4: (2001/11/07)
	- Improved handling of reading annotations in imported text;
	  ChaSen parser can now be used with texts with reading annotations.
	- Changed annotation editor to only expand tree for selected
	  annotation. This speeds up document display and decreases
	  memory usage.
	- Added find option.
	- Added open recent menu.
	- Input focus can be switched to annotation editor with TAB key.
	- Fixed escaping of special characters in LaTeX export.
	- Enlarged text input fields in annotation editor.
	- Fixes to JGloss-WWW.
0.9.3: (2001/09/14)
	- Annotations can now have more than one reading. In a word with
	  more than one kanji substring, a reading is added for every
	  substring. Non-kanji substrings don't get a reading annotation.
	- Changed HTML generation. The generated HTML is now simpler, but
	  may not work as well as previously with browsers which don't
	  support ruby elements.
	- There are now two text parsers, the previous "Kanji" parser and
	  a parser which uses the ChaSen morphological analysis tool.
	- Manual annotation addition now displays a dialog which lets you
	  look up the annotation in the dictionaries before you add it.
	- Fixed bug where the document would sometimes scroll to a
	  different location if a reading/translation is changed.
	- Fixed document name setting in save as.
	- Fixed JJDX creation for dictionaries with more than 500.000
	  index entries.
0.9.2: (2001/08/13)
	- Added dialog for looking up words in the dictionaries.
	- Extreme speedup of EDICT lookups. The old entry match test was
	  really broken.
	- Changed EDICT indexing algorithm. The new algorithm is faster
	  and uses far less RAM.
	- Added French translation, contributed by Alexandre Beraud
	  (currently incomplete).
	- Added paste import window. Text pasted in this window will be
	  imported in a new JGloss document. This is mainly useful
	  for working with the X primary selection. It is accessible with
	  the -p command line option.
	- Added composite verb detection to parser.
	- Added user dictionary.
	- Added dictionary form node to annotation editor. This allows
	  greater control over what will be written in LaTeX and
	  annotation list exports.
	- Added "use for all" function.
	- HTML export: files now show reading and translation in popup
	  windows in browsers which support the neccessary JavaScript
	  functions, and in the status bar.
	- Added command line option -a, which annotates Japanese words in
	  a HTML page with dictionary entries.
	- Creation of the preferences panel and loading of the dictionaries
	  now happens in the background. This decreases the perceived
	  startup time.
	- Popup menus will be positioned to always fit on the screen.
	- A dialog will ask for confirmation before existing files are
	  overwritten.
	- An extension will automatically be added to file names if no
	  extension is given by the user.
	- Opening an already open document will bring the existing window
	  to the front.
	- Added file format version numbering.
        - Added a JGloss servlet. The servlet proxies web pages and
	  annotates them with Japanese translations.
0.9.1: (2001/07/13)
	- Added support for KANJIDIC dictionaries.
	- Added support for SKK word-reading dictionaries.
	- Added command line option for dictionary format detection.
	- Added word exclusion list to automatic annotation.
	- Added index file format JJDX, which can be used instead of
	  XJDX index files. JGloss will create the index if none is
	  found.
	- Added command line options for JJDX creation and opening
	  JGloss files.
	- Added command to remove duplicate annotations.
        - Improved HTML import. Still not very useful, though.
	- Speeded up initial display of documents. Unfortunately,
	  it is still slow.
	- The annotation editor shows readings/translations for hidden
	  annotations.
	- LaTeX: changed ruby size in ruby-annotation.sty
        - Hidden annotations are not expanded after a document
	  is loaded.
	- Fixed addition of space character when starting editing of
	  readings or translations.
	- Fixed apply button in preferences dialog not working.
	- Fixed unchecking background color settings will not change
	  colors.
	- Fixed using 'n' to select next annotation expands hidden
	  annotations.
	- Fixed scrolling of document when using 'n'.
	- Fixed cancel button when adding annotations manually.
0.9: (2001/06/14)
	- Initial release.
