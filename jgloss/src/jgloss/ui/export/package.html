<BODY>
Classes for exporting JGloss documents to other formats.
<p>
JGloss documents are stored as XML documents which conform to the JGloss
DTD. Exporting JGloss documents to other formats is done by applying XSLT
templates to the XML document to generate HTML, plain text, LaTeX or
other formats.
</p><p>
Export descriptor documents in XML format are used to specify the export
options of an export format. The descriptor defines the name of the export
menu item, parameters which may be configured by the user and are passed to
the XSLT export template and the links to the XSLT export templates
themselves. The export descriptor files are stored in
<code>src/data/export</code>.
</p><p>
The XSLT export templates are normal XSLT documents, which are applied
to a JGloss XML document. The export mechanism additionally supplies them
with parameters which are defined by the export descriptor and can be
accessed in the XSLT document by defining a global xsl:param element.
</p><p>
Instances of class {@link jgloss.ui.export.Exporter Exporter} run the
export process. Each instance is configured from a single export descriptor
XML file. The exporter runs the export file chooser and starts the XML
transformation from the XSLT file.
