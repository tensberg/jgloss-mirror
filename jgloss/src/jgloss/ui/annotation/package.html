</HEAD>
<BODY>
Classes specific to the annotation editor tree.
<P>
The {@link jgloss.ui.annotation.AnnotationModel AnnotationModel} is a tree view of all
annotations in the document. 
Children of the root node are {@link jgloss.ui.annotation.AnnotationNode AnnotationNodes}, which each
wrap one annotation element. The <CODE>AnnotationNodes</CODE> are ordered by their position in
the document.
</P><P>
Each <CODE>AnnotationNode</CODE> has two {@link jgloss.ui.annotation.ReadingTranslationNode
ReadingTranslationNodes} as children. One allows the edit of the current ruby, the other the edit of the
current translation of this element. Additional children are created for the
dictionary entries which were found for this annotation.
</P>
