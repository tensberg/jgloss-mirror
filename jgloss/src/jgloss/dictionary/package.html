<BODY>
Backend for parsing japanese text, looking for readings and translations of words.
<P>
Use instances of {@link jgloss.dictionary.Dictionary Dictionary} to look up individual words
in a single dictionary,
or instances of {@link jgloss.dictionary.Parser Parser} to look up words in a japanese text
in a set of dictionaries.
</P><P>
Note that {@link jgloss.dictionary.Dictionary Dictionary} instances use 
{@link jgloss.dictionary.WordReadingPair WordReadingPair} and
{@link jgloss.dictionary.DictionaryEntry DictionaryEntry} objects as lookup results,
while {@link jgloss.dictionary.Parser Parser} uses {@link jgloss.dictionary.Reading Reading}
and {@link jgloss.dictionary.Translation} objects as results.
