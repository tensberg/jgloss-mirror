</HEAD>
<BODY>
Dictionary attribute classes. 
<p>
Besides the word, reading and translation fields,
{@linkplain jgloss.dictionary.DictionaryEntry dictionary entries}
have attributes which contain additional information. For each attribute
type there is a unique instance of the {@link jgloss.dictionary.attribute.Attribute Attribute} interface
which marks the attribute. The {@link jgloss.dictionary.attribute.Attributes Attributes class} is the
default implementation of the interface and contains a collection of standard
attributes as static members. Dictionary implementations may define their
own attributes in addition to the standard ones.
</p><p>
An attribute may have one or more values, which are instances of
{@link jgloss.dictionary.attribute.AttributeValue AttributeValue}. Several standard value classes
are defined which are used by the standard attributes. Attribute values
for one attribute are stored in a {@link jgloss.dictionary.attribute.ValueList ValueList}.
Attributes for one category of a dictionary entry and their values are collected
in a {@link jgloss.dictionary.attribute.AttributeSet AttributeSet}.
</p><p>
To create a string representation of attributes and their values, instances
of {@link jgloss.dictionary.attribute.AttributeFormatter AttributeFormatter} are used.
