LaTeX2e macro for adding ruby to a word
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The files ruby-annotation.sty (originally named ruby.sty) and ruby.doc are
taken from the CJK 4.2.0 macro package for LaTeX2e, written by Werner Lemberg
<wl@gnu.org>. You can find a copy of the package at http://www.ctan.org/. It
is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2.

You can use the macro in conjunction with platex (Japanese LaTeX) which
is included with TeTeX.
