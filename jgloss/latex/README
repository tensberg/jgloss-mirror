LaTeX export templates
----------------------

The folder "templates" contains copies of the templates used by the JGloss
LaTeX export function. You may modify the templates to suit your needs or
use them as examples to write your own templates.

To use a new or modified template, choose the "Add" entry in the LaTeX
export template chooser, and select the template file. You can now select
this file in the template chooser.

ruby-annotation.sty: LaTeX2e macro for adding ruby to a word
------------------------------------------------------------

The files ruby-annotation.sty (originally named ruby.sty) and ruby.doc are
taken from the CJK 4.2.0 macro package for LaTeX2e, written by Werner
Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>. You can find a copy of the package at
http://www.ctan.org/. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License Version 2.

You can use the macro together with platex (Japanese LaTeX; included with
TeTeX) to add ruby to a word. Since the macro is a part of the CJK package,
there is no need to install ruby-annotation.sty if you use CJK.
